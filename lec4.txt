VM FT does not handle network partitions outright. It's not possible that if the primary and backup end up in different network partitions that it runs with two different primaries. This is because, by definition, if the network is partitioned, then the nodes in one partition cannot communicate with another. They don't know of each other's existence. What may happen is that the primary and backup both think the other is dead and so the original primary seeks out a new backup and the original backup becomes a primary and seeks a backup. In which case they are in fact both primaries starting from the same (or close to the same) state but the original primary is still connected to the client and will likely branch off from the node that was once a backup but is now a primary.
