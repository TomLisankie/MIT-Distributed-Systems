Say there is a client that needs to access a chunk. The client asks the master for the locations of the replicas of the chunk. The client caches these locations. Before the client goes to read the data from one of the cached locations, a few things happen: 1) the location it is going to decide to read from crashes, 2) some other clients mutate the contents of the chunk and this mutation is shown across all replicas except the one that is down, 3) the location comes back online. Now, the client goes to read the data from the location with the stale data because it still thinks that location has the most up-to-date version of the chunk. It receives stale data back.
